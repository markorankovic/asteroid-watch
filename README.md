# asteroid-watch
This was part of a group project I did during my third year of university.
To try this demo, open the repository in a Java IDE e.g. Eclipse and setting the variables start_date and end_date with max 7 days apart and running the code, you will get a presentation of a size comparison between all the near-Earth asteroids passing Earth in that time interval.
