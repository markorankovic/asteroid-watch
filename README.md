To use this app

1. Start by specifying the start and end date on the main screen when entering the app. This will specify the dates asteroids pass Earth that you want to observe. 

2. The list which follows shows for each asteroid its name, the diameter(m), the velocity it approaches Earth at, the miss distance between the asteroid and Earth and warning signs that pulsate at the top left corner indicate that the asteroid is potentially hazardous to NASA's standards.

3. To get a 3D size comparison view of the asteroids, rotate the phone to landscape and hold it close to 90Â° angle relative to you. To scroll through the comparison scene, swipe left and right.
